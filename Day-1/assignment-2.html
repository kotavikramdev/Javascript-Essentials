        <h2>Difference between var, let, and const in Javascript</h2>
        <p>In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.</p>
        <h3>var:</h3>
        <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword 'var' is limited to the 'function' within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
            <b>var is "function scoped"</b>.</p>
        <h3>let:</h3>
        <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword 'let' is limited to the 'block' defined by curly braces i.e. {}.
            <b>let is "block scoped"</b>.</p>
        <h3>const:</h3>
        <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword 'const' is limited to the 'block' defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword 'const', it cannot be reassigned.</p>
        <p><b>"const" cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it can be mutated</b>.</p>
        <h2>Examples:</h2>
        <script>
            var a=10;
            let b=20;
            const PI=3.14;
            document.write("variable 'a' declared using 'var' = "+a);
            document.write('<br/>');
            document.write("variable 'b' declared using 'let' = "+b);
            document.write('<br/>');
            document.write("variable 'PI' declared using 'const' = "+PI);
        </script>
